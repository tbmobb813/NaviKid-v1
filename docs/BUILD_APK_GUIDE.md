# Building APK for Sideloading - Complete Guide

## Summary

Building an APK from your Expo project requires either:

1. **A connected Android device/emulator** (for `npx expo run:android`)

1. **EAS Build** (cloud or local) with proper authentication

1. **Manual Gradle build** (complex, has autolinking issues)

---

## Current Issue

- ❌ No Android device connected (USB not working)

- ❌ Emulator won't start (disk space: need 7.4GB, have 6.4GB)

- ❌ EAS login failed (wrong credentials or account issue)

- ❌ Direct Gradle build failing due to React Native autolinking

---

## RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Fix USB Connection (BEST - 5 minutes)

**This is the fastest path to a working APK!**

1. **On your Android phone:**
   - Plug in USB cable

   - Pull down notification shade

   - Tap USB notification

   - Change to **"File Transfer"** or **"MTP"** mode

1. **Enable USB Debugging:**

   ```text
   Settings → About phone → Tap "Build number" 7 times
   Settings → Developer options → Enable "USB debugging"
   ```


1. **Check connection:**

   ```bash
   adb devices
   # Should show your device
   ```


1. **Build APK:**

   ```bash
   cd /home/jason/Projects/Kid-Friendly-Map-v1
   npx expo run:android --variant release
   ```


1. **Find your APK:**

   ```bash
   find android/app/build/outputs/apk -name "*.apk"
   ```


The APK will be at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

---

### Option 2: Use Expo Go to Test (IMMEDIATE)

While fixing the USB/APK build issue, test your app NOW:

1. **Install "Expo Go"** from Play Store

1. **Connect phone and computer to same WiFi**

1. **Start Metro:**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```


1. **Press `s`** to switch to Expo Go mode

1. **Scan QR code** with Expo Go app

**Limitations:**

- ❌ MapLibre won't work (needs native modules)

- ❌ MMKV won't work (needs native modules)

- ✅ CAN test navigation (the main fix!)

- ✅ CAN test UI/UX flow

- ✅ CAN verify @react-navigation/native@7.1.8 fix works

---

### Option 3: Free More Disk Space for Emulator

You need ~1-2GB more space.

**Quick cleanup:**

```bash
# Clean more caches
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf ~/.npm ~/.cache

# Clean Android SDK caches
rm -rf ~/.android/build-cache
rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches

# Remove old kernels (be careful!)
sudo apt autoremove --purge

# Check space
df -h /
```


**If you get to 8GB+ free:**

```bash
# Create smaller emulator
avdmanager create avd -n Dev_Small -k "system-images;android-36;google_apis_playstore;x86_64" -d pixel_5

# Edit config to use less disk
echo "disk.dataPartition.size=2048M" >> ~/.android/avd/Dev_Small.avd/config.ini

# Start emulator
emulator -avd Dev_Small &

# Wait 30-60 seconds
adb devices

# Build
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

### Option 4: Fix EAS Login and Build on Cloud

**Reset your Expo password:**

1. Go to <https://expo.dev/>

1. Click "Forgot password"

1. Reset using <jsn.nix@gmail.com>

**Then build in cloud:**

```bash
eas login
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```


**Advantages:**

- ✅ No local disk space needed

- ✅ Professional build setup

- ✅ Downloads ready APK

**Disadvantages:**

- ⏱️ Takes 10-15 minutes

- 🌐 Requires internet

- 💰 Free tier has build limits

---

### Option 5: Use GitHub Codespaces / Cloud Dev Environment

If local builds keep failing, build in the cloud:

1. **Push your code to GitHub**

1. **Open in Codespaces**

1. **Build there** (unlimited disk space!)

1. **Download APK**

---

## What I Recommend RIGHT NOW

**Do these in parallel:**

**TRACK A (Testing - 2 minutes):**

1. Install Expo Go on your phone

1. Run `npx expo start`

1. Scan QR code

1. Test that navigation works!

1. At least confirm the @react-navigation fix solved the main issue

**TRACK B (Building - 5 minutes):**

1. Try USB connection one more time
   - Change phone to "File Transfer" mode

   - Enable USB debugging

   - Run `adb devices`

1. If device appears → Run `npx expo run:android --variant release`

1. Done! APK is at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

**If USB still fails:**

- Consider Option 3 (free more space) or Option 4 (EAS cloud build)

---

## Alternative: Use Wireless ADB (If USB is Broken)

If your USB port or cable is truly broken:

1. **Connect phone and laptop to same WiFi**

1. **On phone:**

   ```text
   Settings → Developer options → Wireless debugging → ON
   Tap "Pair device with pairing code"
   ```


1. **On laptop:**

   ```bash
   adb pair <IP>:<PORT>
   # Enter pairing code

   adb connect <IP>:<PORT>
   adb devices
   ```


1. **Then build:**

   ```bash
   npx expo run:android --variant release
   ```

| Method       | Time   | Requirements            | Success Rate              |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| USB Device   | 5 min  | Working USB + Debugging | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐                |
| Wireless ADB | 10 min | Same WiFi + Android 11+ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐                  |
| Emulator     | 15 min | 8GB+ free disk space    | ⭐⭐⭐                    |

## Current Status

✅ **Navigation error FIXED** (@react-navigation/native@7.1.8)
✅ **Project prebuild complete** (android/ directory exists)
⚠️ **Disk space low** (6.4GB free, need 7.4GB+ for emulator)
❌ **No device connected** (USB mode issue)
❌ **EAS login failed** (credentials issue)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Try USB fix** (5 minutes max)

1. **If that fails, use Expo Go** to at least test the navigation fix works

1. **Then decide:** Free disk space for emulator OR fix EAS login for cloud build
