### Option 2: Polish First (12-14 hours) ← RECOMMENDED

```
Timeline: 1 week
Status:   Ready with improvements
Tasks:    Fix tests (6-8h) + reduce `any` (2-3h) + CI/CD (2-3h)

```

Best balance of launch speed and quality.

2. ✅ Improves code quality significantly
3. ✅ Adds CI/CD safety net for future
4. ✅ Sets strong technical foundation
5. ✅ Total effort: Just 12-14 hours
6. ✅ Risk: Very low (all work is optional improvement)

**Timeline**:

- Days 1-2: Fix service tests + reduce `any` types
- Days 3-4: Set up CI/CD
- Day 5: Final verification
- End of week: Deploy
