## Running tests

This project separates tests into three suites: frontend, server, and bun-style logic/perf tests.

To run frontend tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run server tests:

```bash
npm run test:server
```

To run bun tests (logic + performance):

```bash
npm run test:bun
```

### Performance tests

The bun performance tests include timing-based assertions. To avoid false failures on slower developer machines, use the `PERF_TIME_MULTIPLIER` environment variable locally, e.g.:

```bash
PERF_TIME_MULTIPLIER=2 npm run test:bun
```

CI will run the strict checks with `PERF_TIME_MULTIPLIER=1`. The nightly workflow runs a strict performance job.
