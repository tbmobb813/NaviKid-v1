## Technical Approach

### Refactoring Methodology

Each component followed a systematic 4-step process:

1. **Analysis** - Read and understand component structure
2. **Hook Extraction** - Extract business logic into custom hooks
3. **Component Extraction** - Create reusable UI sub-components
4. **Composition** - Refactor main component to pure composition

### Best Practices Applied

✅ **Separation of Concerns**
- Business logic in custom hooks
- UI presentation in sub-components
- Main component as pure composition layer

✅ **Reusability**
- Sub-components designed for reuse across features
- Consistent prop interfaces
- Shared styling patterns

✅ **Type Safety**
- All components fully typed with TypeScript strict mode
- Proper prop type definitions
- Type-safe hook returns

✅ **Testability**
- Hooks independently testable
- Sub-components isolated for unit testing
- Main components testable through integration tests

✅ **Maintainability**
- Clear file organization (dedicated subdirectories)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive index.ts exports

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Systematic Approach**: 4-step process ensured consistency
2. **Hooks First**: Extracting business logic first made UI extraction easier
3. **Index Files**: Barrel exports simplified imports
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript caught issues during refactoring
5. **Git Commits**: Individual commits per component aided review

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Complex State**: Some components had deeply nested state (solved with custom hooks)
2. **Prop Drilling**: Mitigated with proper component composition
3. **Platform Differences**: Photo check-in had web/mobile split (handled in hook)
4. **Circular Dependencies**: Avoided through proper file organization

### Best Practices Confirmed

- Always read file before editing
- Extract business logic before UI
- Create dedicated subdirectories for component families
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for clean imports
- Maintain type safety throughout refactoring
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages

## Next Steps

### Documentation ✅
- [x] Update PROJECT_BREAKDOWN.md
- [x] Create REFACTORING_SUMMARY_2025-12-03.md
